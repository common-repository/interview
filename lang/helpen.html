<div style="padding: 20px;border: 1px solid">
	<ol>
		<li>You create an interview</li>
		<li>You invite by email user(s) for the interview.</li>
		<li>You publish the interview once users have answered to the interview's questions.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<h2>
	Some extra features:
</h2>

<h4>Request an interview to an user (you ask an user to answer to your interview questions)</h4>
<p>
	Request an interview means an user will have to answer to questions : to integrate an interview into one of your pages or posts, just copy / paste shortcode:
	<b>[interview id=number]</b>
</p>
<p>
	ex: for interview number 3, paste:
</p>
<div class="shortcode">[interview id=3]</div>

<p>
	<span class="dashicons dashicons-lightbulb"></span>
	An user must be <b>registered and logged on</b> to pass an interview. Guest users cannot pass an interview. That's why when you invite someone, you can create an new WP user for this person.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Publish / playback a recorded interview: once interviewed finished, publish its content into your post or page.</h4>
<p>
	That means that you can publish an interview an user have done on a page or on post.
</p>
<p>You can simply create a new post with interview inside simply by clicking the button "publish [email] interview"</p>


<p>You can also do it manually by using the following shortcode</p>
<p>ex: user whose email is user@email.com has completed interview number 3</p>
<div class="shortcode">[interviewPublish id=3 email=user@email.com]</div>
